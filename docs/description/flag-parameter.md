## flag-parameter

_Description_: If a function controls the flow of another by passing it information on what to do, both functions are said to be [control-coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)#Procedural_programming).
Coupling among functions must be minimized for better maintainability of the code.
This rule warns on boolean parameters that create a control coupling.

_Configuration_: N/A
